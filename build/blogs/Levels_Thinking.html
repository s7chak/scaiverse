  I read through Wilber's Integral Theory to find a potential way to categorize
  all of knowledge that humankind has accumulated over eons. However, I come
  across the levels of thinking and got immediately drawn to the stages as per
  this framework. It's important to note that Ken Wilber's Integral Theory is a
  theoretical framework, an endeavor in build a categorical structure of the
  world we experience. Its applicability and validity is, of course, subject to
  ongoing debate and research within the fields of psychology, philosophy, and
  cognitive science. The framework referred as "All Quadrants All Levels" or
  AQAL Theory categorizes fields of knowledge into quadrants, stages of
  consciousness and awareness as levels of thinking, and lines representing
  progress through different intelligences and states and types and so on. And I
  think the all quadrant all levels naming comes from an attempt at attaining
  these levels, mastering all quadrants and levels leads to an integrated world
  - a version of an ideal world. This is not a scientific theory as
  Gravitational laws or thermodynamics, but I think it serves me one goal quite
  adeptly, and that is categorization.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  About these levels, they go up from basal instincts and thinking patterns to more holistic, integrated, nuanced and possibly to a more conscious way of thinking. Going up is not necessarily good and staying down is not bad, or so they say. And that's it for the disclaimers before we go through them one by one. The levels are written from bottom to top as they make sense in altitudes of not really consciousness, but - it is difficult to put in words, so I'll use what I have for now - possibly sophistication.

<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Transcendent:</b> Transcendent thinking represents the highest level of
    human consciousness, characterized by mystical experiences, spiritual
    awakening, and a sense of oneness with the universe. Individuals at this
    level may experience a profound sense of interconnectedness with all
    existence and a transcendence of the ego or individual self.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <b>Universal:</b> Universal thinking transcends individual perspectives and
    identities, embracing a sense of unity, compassion, and global
    responsibility. Individuals at this level develop a deep sense of
    interconnectedness with all beings and a commitment to the well-being of the
    entire planet.
  </li>
  <br/>
  ...
  <br/>
  <li>
    <b>Pluralistic:</b> Pluralistic thinking embraces diversity, inclusivity,
    and relativism. Individuals at this level recognize multiple perspectives
    and the importance of social justice and equality. They acknowledge that
    different cultures and worldviews can coexist and have validity within their
    respective contexts.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <b>Rational:</b> The rational level is characterized by logic, reason, and
    critical analysis. Individuals at this stage prioritize empirical evidence
    and scientific inquiry, relying on objective data and rational thought
    processes to understand the world around them.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <b>Mythical:</b> Mythical thinking involves adherence to traditional
    cultural narratives, religious dogma, and moral absolutes. Individuals at
    this level find a strong sense of community and belonging within the shared
    beliefs and rituals of their culture or religion.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>Magical:</b> At this level, individuals exhibit a magical or animistic
    worldview, where reality is interpreted through superstition, myth, and
    supernatural beliefs. Causality is often attributed to unseen forces or
    beings, and there is a lack of differentiation between the self and the
    external world.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>Archaic:</b> This is the most fundamental level, where individuals
    operate primarily on instinctual and survival-based behaviors. There is
    little to no self-awareness or cognitive complexity at this stage, as the
    focus is solely on meeting basic physiological needs.
  </li>
  <br />
  <!-- <li>
    <b>Integral:</b> Integral thinking integrates and transcends previous
    levels, synthesizing diverse perspectives and embracing complexity, paradox,
    and interconnectivity. Individuals at this stage can hold multiple
    viewpoints simultaneously and recognize the interconnectedness of all
    phenomena.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>Holistic:</b> Holistic thinking emphasizes interconnectedness, systems
    thinking, and ecological awareness. Individuals at this level recognize the
    interdependence of all life forms and phenomena, and they strive to
    understand the broader context and relationships within complex systems.
  </li>

  These levels of thinking are neither rigid nor mutually exclusive. People
  generally exhibit characteristics of multiple levels simultaneously or glide
  between them fluidly sometimes with the same conversation. Also, the
  progression through these levels is not necessarily linear nor guaranteed.
  Some individuals may remain at lower levels due to various factors, such as
  cultural conditioning, personal experiences, or cognitive limitations.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  It's important to recognize that each level of thinking serves a purpose and
  has value within its appropriate context. The lower levels, such as the
  archaic, magical, and mythical levels, provide a sense of belonging,
  community, and meaning, which are essential for psychological well-being and
  social cohesion. The higher ones, in this context, help see a bigger picture
  of humanity, reality and may bring their own flavors of wellbeing to the mind
  thinking at these stages.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The common wisdom about Integral Theory's levels of thinking is the following:
  While the transcendent and universal levels represent profound states of
  consciousness and awareness, they should not be pursued at the expense of
  neglecting the foundational levels that support our basic needs, practical
  functioning, and connection to our immediate communities and identities.
</p>
<p>
  My understanding so far has this opinion/confusion: As we progress through the
  levels, and say one day we have a thought at the universal or eighth level, we
  do not lose our ability to think at lower levels. Even if some people find it
  amusing, intellectually orgasmic or life-affirmingly meaningful, the level
  implies the "host" is aware of all previous levels and recognizes their unique
  utility and contribution to their life.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The ability to navigate and integrate various levels of thinking is crucial
  for a balanced and holistic perspective, no doubt. Individuals who can
  appreciate and draw upon the strengths of different levels are better equipped
  to navigate the complexities of life and adapt to diverse situations. And so
  if my definition of the higher levels with the intrinsic awareness and
  acceptance of all that came before applies, we should be striving to think at
  the higher levels and keep returning back to reality, or pragmatism when the
  time calls.
