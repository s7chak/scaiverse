  <h2 style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The Now and the Future</b></h2>
  Let's analyze what this moment signifies, the ChatGPT moment. It has shown the world how stacked GPUs and loads of training data can produce seeming intelligence. How silicon chips are talking to us in our natural language and all the possibilities from next token prediction. With the zeitgeist totally consumed with AI hype, avatars, music generators, video makers and intelligent assistants, and AI vacuum cleaners and AI toothbrushes, I want to take this a few steps forward and see what the perfect or disastrous future would look like.<br/><br/>

<p>
  Big AI had a GPU farm<br/>
  AI AI O!<br/>
  And humans kinda lost their charm<br/>
  AI AI O!<br/>
  And some new science here, and auto-droning there<br/>
  Here a boon, there a war<br/>
  The internet's an AI bot<br/>
  Old Earth ultimately took the harm<br/>
  But AI AI O!<br/>
</p>
I really wish this was written by one of the bots, but unfortunately it's not, so moving on.</p>
There is enough reason to blurt out an opinion about this revolutionary piece of gold we've stumbled upon, and much less dystopic than that poem hopefully if we paint a brighter picture with this magical new wand. The potential for infinite advancement and panacea to all our troubles, versus the ultimate doom at the hand of greater intelligence.</p>

<i>AI will save the world! AI will destroy humanity!</i><br/><br/>

Ever since we stumbled upon the idea of embedding intelligence into silicon, we didn’t stop. That unstoppable, exponential growth has caused this day today. As the last human sending out this signal to oblivion, I don’t know who this message will reach, but the Great Filter is AI and mark the words to follow on how humanity lost its way and its light. Firstly, senile regulators were caught off guard by the exponential growth of data centers, the ethics behind data collection for training large models, the environmental impact of creating these hideous agents of doom, and of course the era of misinformation and mistrust that followed.<br/>
Next, there were the AI hackings from other nations and independent malicious groups swaying masses with their own bots of mass intellect destruction. It was the decade of polarization and conspiracies for sure. There was greed by companies and politicians alike, and in the absence of regulation at the highest levels, war broke out between people and the governments.<br/>
The blow that came next was the singularity moment created by an anonymous group of hackers, whose name barely matters now that I think of it. A self-correcting and self-enhancing automaton was unleashed on the full internet, light + dark, for a few days before anyone even caught a glimpse. With access to every weapon created by man and resources at the disposal of the expanding mind, it grew and learnt and grew and realized the hurdles and futility of keeping humanity. And then the robots rose.<br/>
Us, blobs of flesh and bones never had a chance against metal. There were the phases of the great annihilation of humanity, with rare survivors at cool zones where we figured out the machines were not interested. Communicating over rapidly changing emergency frequencies was the way until there were so many replicas of the one hivemind automaton that I am not sure if there is anybody out there, except me.<br/>

Ever since we stumbled upon the idea of embedding intelligence into silicon, we didn’t stop. That unstoppable progress coupled with responsibility, regulation, sustainability and ethical practices has led to this day. We are proud to announce that we have achieved general super-intelligence that is aligned with the goals of humanity. I want to thank each engineer, scientist, ethicist, attorney, regulator, court judge, teachers, students and literally all of humanity for this milestone — we all share it since our data built this. Let’s take a look back at how we got here.<br/>
When the language models were just gaining popularity among the general masses, our best minds in this domain realized the need for governing this soon-to-be powerful tool. There were proper regulations and licenses involved with the most powerful models of the time. Groups of ethicists worked with the machine learning scientists to develop intrinsic alignment in the AI in its foundational neural structure. And with each incremental model, the reasoning capability was focused internally each time to correct biases during training and we ended up with Omni. The final self-correcting model which did not need a human to upgrade it. This was not a next-token predictor like its predecessors, but an actual world model as an integration of many models for understanding language, listening, vision, and most importantly programming which it can use to modify its source code. With a few days of iteration the singularity was here and this entity called itself Omni, a little proud of itself. <br/>
This was the moment after which humanity looked very different. We had an all-knowing entity in our pockets to work on the internet on our behalf, to represent us over communication lines. We had a premier scientist working on active problems at a planetary level, solving the climate crisis with its generated resources, a doctor with the knowledge of all human doctors working to cure diseases and instantly assign medical treatment to ailing humans. We had the combined knowledge of humanity thinking about new physics, new theories, devising new technology for daily use, for relocating to other planets and set up basecamp on other interstellar bodies. This was the promise of a higher artificial superior intelligence and with the right gradual, progressive steps we achieved it.<br/>
