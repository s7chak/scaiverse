<p><i>I love to learn and I simply would not stop.</i></p>
<br />
<p>
  It will be a true satisfaction at the end of this brief stint on a hurtling
  ball of life though space, for me, knowing a thing or two, having understood a
  few iotas of reality and gained some practical skills along the way. But
  that's not really the point of learning nor its primary benefit.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The information era of humans is in full swing - a land of attention
  economies, society-altering algorithms, a new synthetic intelligence and a
  barrage of information with needle-in-a-haystack chance of insights. Given
  this and the fact that I engage with this rapidly accelerating world in its microcosm of data
  science, I find it crucial to adopt lifelong learning in theory and in
  practice. The upsides range from avoiding cognitive decline, building career
  resilience, expanded perspective, improved decision-making, confidence and
  simply, joy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The Learner's Manifesto encapsulates the essence of this philosophy, its
  blueprint and procedures serving potentially as guardrails for those who
  aspire to cultivate curiosity, expand their knowledge, and keep growing as
  human beings. It is a testament to the belief that learning is not confined to
  the classroom or limited by age but is a lifelong voyage of exploration and
  discovery. I see these principles as a map for the eudaemonic landscape, with
  not just wellbeing but flourishing as the end goal, and honestly, it's the
  only kind of self-help I tolerate. So read on, if you want to find yourself in
  your eighties still picking up a book, still a student of life, keeping pace
  with the zeitgeist and engaging deeply with universe.

<b>Curiosity is Paramount</b><br />
This was literally what birthed Science - the driving force behind all discoveries, technological advancements, and humanity's collective progress. The curious mind is never stagnant, and has consistently been a catalyst for exploration and better understanding.
<br /><br />
<p>
<b>Minds are Malleable</b><br />
Our minds are not static entities but dynamic and adaptable, capable of growth and transformation. The brain's plasticity has been proven and its ability to adapt and rewire itself throughout our lives, it is only fair to shape it in the right ways in the direction of truth.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Acquiring New Skills is the Hobby</b><br />
In the pursuit of mastery, our primary hobby should be picking up new tools for our toolkit. With each new skill mastered we expand our horizons, opening doors to new opportunities and experiences. Also the added effect of looking through a different lens, adding perspective.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Critically Check New Ideas</b><br />
In an age of information overload, it is essential to exercise discernment and critical thinking. We scrutinize new ideas with a skeptical eye, separating fact from fiction and embracing intellectual rigor in the pursuit of truth.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Challenge Ingrained Notions</b><br />
Recognizing one's own biases and influences, we see strength in editing beliefs based on evidence. Placing truth at the top of our virtue tier list, we constantly find evidence for the opposite side of a stance.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Diversified Toolkit</b><br />
Just as a balanced diet nourishes the body, a diverse range of interests does the same for the mind. We partake in the intellectual buffet of life, sampling knowledge from various disciplines and savoring the richness of human thought and creativity.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Learn from Failing</b><br />
Failure is not a setback but the only way through to success. We embrace failure
as an opportunity for growth, learning valuable lessons from our mistakes and
emerging stronger and wiser with each setback.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Share Learned Insight</b><br />
Teaching is learning twice. We all stand on the shoulders of giants and it is a responsibility to pass on knowledge; without it there would be no progress like today.
</p><br />
<p>
<b>Stay Humble</b><br />
In our quest for knowledge and self-improvement, we remain humble, recognizing that there is always more to learn and discover. With humility as our guiding principle, we approach the world with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The growing evidence towards this is just staggering - that learning prevents cognitive decline, that most early retirees seek some stimulation or get back to work, that an organization which promotes regular learning is the one to succeed in the long run through innovation, that adaptive individuals have more confidence and peace of mind regarding their career.
This fast world we have inherited is not going to slow down any time within our lifetimes, and so we keep stepping forward with it, picking up new shovels, sharpening old axes, extracting insight out of data, all wrapped in an envelope of play and fun.
